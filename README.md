# ClipboardUrlSovietizer
Simple service for beautifying URLs passed to clipboard, decodes cyrillic and other special characters in URLs, however it will probably break a URL which contains encoded `/` (`%2F`), so use with caution.

### How-To:
 - Download and put [exectutable](https://github.com/Xorboo/ClipboardUrlSovietizer/releases) somewhere
 - Launch it, add to autorun if you want
 - Minimize to system tray, you can enable/disable it from context menu
 
 ### About
 Made for "was bored on weekend" reasons, probably noone should ever use it. Icon borrowed from [Ignus_](https://www.reddit.com/r/civbattleroyale/comments/3z7x3r/polandball_icon_soviet_union/).
